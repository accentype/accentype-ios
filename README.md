AccenType iOS
============

Latin-based languages use the same alphabet as English with only difference being the accents of letters (e.g. for Spanish, Italian, German, Vietnamese, French, etc...). On an English keyboard, user is required to type a combination of keys to create an "accented" letter, which can be cumbersome. For example: typing "aa" creates "â", or "ALT + 142" creates "Ä". Via Machine Learning techniques, AccenType can predict accents with high accuracy without requiring users to enter the long combined sequence of keys. This could save at least 50% time in typing documents, emails, etc... For a live demo, please visit: http://accentype.azurewebsites.net/

Built on top of the [Tasty Imitation Keyboard](https://github.com/archagon/tasty-imitation-keyboard/) and currently in prototype stage. As such there is no listing on the App Store, in order to test the app a local development environment is required.
